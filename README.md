# UFOs
##Overview of the analysis:
We created a dynamic webpage that contains UFO sightings around the US. The webpage is dynamic because the user may filter the available data by the date of the sighting, the location or the shape of what was seen. Additionally, the user may read through the comments for each of the sightings. 

## Results:
The user may filter the information by one or more criteria. The user can filter the data only by date or add any additional criteria such as city, state, country or the shape. The filters are case sensitive and words should be entered using lower case and an exact match to view the desired output. The filter boxes do contain sample text for the user to follow as a guide. Below is an image of the filter search boxes and a sample of the type of the data that is provided.

## Summary:
The webpage has some limitations. As previously mentioned the filter is case sensitive and will only match to an exact match. Any mispellings or approximations will not provide a result. 

Other future improvements should include updating the data as it becomes available. The data is being pulled from a file and therefore is static and will easily become outdated as new sightings develop and time passes. Additionally, including other filters would be helpful in filtering the data for sightings where the user does not know the exact details but is able to search by a entering a key word or even the year as opposed to the exact date.
